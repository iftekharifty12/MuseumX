    <p class="card-text">Small bottle, probably Northern India, circa first third 17th Century A.D., 46 millimeters high.The "kundan" technique in jewelry also corresponds to the widespread use of inlaid hardstones in Islamic culture, and typifies the Mughal period in India: just as jewels were inlaid with precious rubies and emeralds, the interior marble walls of famous buildings like the Taj Mahal were inlaid with malachite, tiger's eye, carnelian and lapis lazuli on a staggering scale. The dome of the Taj Mahal once held precious rubies, diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, but they were vandalized over the centuries.</p>
